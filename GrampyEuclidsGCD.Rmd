# Greatest common divisor of $a$ and $b$, $a\leq b$
_from Aaron Grecius_

**Ingredients** Two positive integers $a$ and $b$, $a\leq b$.

**Cooking Time** Approximately $\log a$ steps.

**Attribution** From Grampy Euclid's cookbook.

**Recipe**

- Write $b=aq+r$ with $0\leq r<a$.
- If $r=0$, $a$ is $\gcd(a,b)$.
- Otherwise, discard $b$, rename $a$ as $b$, rename $r$ as $a$ and return to Step 1.

Guten Appetit!
