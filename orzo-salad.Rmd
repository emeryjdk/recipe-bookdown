Cook orzo according to directions on package --- slightly al dente is fine as well. Drain and rise with cold water.

\ingredient[\fr34]{cup}{dried cranberries}

Finely chop dried cranberries (craisins) and spinach. Add to orzo in a large serving bowl.

\ingredient[\fr34]{cup}{feta cheese}
\ingredient[\fr34]{cup}{balsamic vinaigrette}
\ingredient[\fr12]{tsp}{dried basil}
\ingredient[\fr14]{tsp}{white pepper, ground}

Add these ingredients to the mix and toss so that greens are well-coated with the vinaigrette. Flavored vinaigrette is a nice touch (e.g., strawberry). Refrigerate if not serving immediately.

\ingredient[\fr14]{cup}{sunflower seeds}

Toss in sunflower seeds prior to serving.
