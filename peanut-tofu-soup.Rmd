2. Using a small blender or mortal and pestle, combine the jalapenos, ginger, and garlic together with a pinch of salt until a coarse paste forms.
3. Add this paste to the pot with the carrots and onions and continue cooking until fragrant.
4. Add diced tomatoes, crushed tomatoes, coconut milk, and peanut butter.  Bring to a boil and reduce to a simmer, stirring to ensure that the peanut butter is completely incorporated.
5. Once the peanut butter is fully incorporated, remove from heat and blend using an immersion blender until smooth.

7. Add tofu to the pot and stir. Bring the soup back to a simmer and cook tofu for 5-10 minutes.
8. Serve immediately with a crusty bread for dipping.
